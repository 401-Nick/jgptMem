### JGPTMem Class

The `JGPTMem` class is designed to facilitate conversations with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model, while managing a short-term memory to provide a more context-aware interaction.

#### Requirements

- The `openai` package.
- Environment variables with the OpenAI API key and organization ID.
- Node.js version compatible with the `openai` package.

#### Constructor: `new JGPTMem(apiKey, orgId)`

Create a new `JGPTMem` instance.

- `apiKey` (String): The OpenAI API key.
- `orgId` (String): The organization ID.

#### Method: `async talk(userInput)`

Receives user input, constructs a prompt with short-term memory instructions, and returns the response from OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.

- `userInput` (String): The user's question or command.

##### Returns

- (String): The response from OpenAI's model, formatted as `{"condensedMemory":condensedSummary, "response": "your answer"}`.

##### Throws

- Error: If there's any error in processing the prompt or fetching the response.

#### Example Usage

```javascript
const jgptMem = new JGPTMem(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY, process.env.OPENAI_ORG_ID);

const userInput = "Tell me about the weather today";

jgptMem.talk(userInput).then(result => console.log(result));
```

This code snippet creates an instance of `JGPTMem`, provides a user question, and prints the response.

#### Note

- Properly configure environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_ORG_ID`) in your `.env` file.
- The `talk` method returns a Promise. Handle it appropriately in your code.
- Error handling is crucial to manage unexpected responses or issues during execution.
- The class emphasizes the importance of continuously updating and condensing short-term memory without significant loss of data.

`JGPTMem` provides a sophisticated way to utilize OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model for interactive conversations, considering previous interactions and maintaining a condensed short-term memory for more contextual responses.
